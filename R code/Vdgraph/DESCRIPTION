Description: Uses a modification of the published FORTRAN code in "A Computer Program for Generating Variance Dispersion Graphs" by G. Vining, Journal of Quality Technology, Vol. 25 No. 1 January 1993, to produce variance dispersion graphs. Also produces fraction of design space plots, and contains data frames for several minimal run response surface designs.
